# Blockchain-Based-Real-Estate-Registration-System
Revolutionizing the property market, our website and app eliminate the need for middlemen in buying or selling property or land.
Users can effortlessly create profiles, and the admin meticulously verifies sellers' properties, ensuring only approved listings are
visible to potential buyers. To fortify security, documents are seamlessly linked with Digilocker (Government API), while payment
transactions are safeguarded through blockchain technology using smart contracts.

Land registry in India as well as in many parts of the world is a very slow and inconvenient process. Current land registration & verification systems include an increasing number of fraud cases and loss of paperwork and court cases due to thousands of land records to maintain.  
The intuition behind building this was to make the process of land registration resilient and decreases the cases of fraud in the process. Using the system, validation of the lands is also possible as immutable transactions are being stored in the public ledger.  
So the Land Registration system using blockchain is a distributed system that will store all the transactions made during the process of land buying. This will also be helpful for buyers, sellers and government registrars to transfer the land ownership from seller to new buyer as well as it will accelerate the process of registration.
